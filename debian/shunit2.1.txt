==========

Name
----
shunit2 - A unit test framework for shell scripts

Synopsis
--------
shunit2 unitfile

Description
------------
shUnit2 is a xUnit unit test framework for Bourne based shell scripts, and it
is designed to work in a similar manner to JUnit, PyUnit, etc.. If you have
ever had the desire to write a unit test for a shell script, shUnit2 can do the
job.

You can either run *shunit2* directly from the commandline and specify the unit file or directly source the *shunit2* executable.

If you directly execute *shunit2* and *don't* specify a unitfile shunit2 assumes a empty testfile and will return without an error message.

Example
--------

Simple script to test if 1 equals 1
----
#! /bin/sh
testEquality()
{
  assertEquals 1 1
}

# load shunit2
. shunit2

----

Execute shUnit2 unit tests directly from the commandline
----
shunit2 /path/to/unit/file
----

Options
-------

*shunit2* does not support any commandline options at all. You can either source shunit2 to execute your unit tests or directly run shunit2 as a commandline script.
